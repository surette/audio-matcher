Brief Testing 10/15/13

Comparing a 16-bit audio file against the same audio file, 
only 24-bit, produces a NO MATCH

Comparing a 16-but audio file with the same 16-but audio file, 
only the left and right channels have been switched, produces a NO MATCH
-----> I feel like we will have to create a check: if nchannels is 2, 
define left as file[0::2] and right as file[1::2] and send both 
separately to get processed and filtered down by our functions. 
If nchannels is 1 (mono) we still define left and right, only 
they will be the same thing. We then compare all possible combos of 
left and right between the two files

Comparing a 16-but audio file against the same 16-but audio file, 
only inverted, produces a MATCH (this is a good thing)
